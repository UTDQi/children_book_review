ABSTRACT = {The identification of optimal drug candidates is very important in drug discovery. Researchers in biology and computational sciences have sought to use machine learning (ML) to efficiently predict drug–target interactions (DTIs). In recent years, according to the emerging usefulness of pretrained models in natural language process (NLPs), pretrained models are being developed for chemical compounds and target proteins. This study sought to improve DTI predictive models using a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers (BERT)-pretrained model, ChemBERTa, for chemical compounds. Pretraining features the use of a simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES). We also employ the pretrained ProBERT for target proteins (pretraining employed the amino acid sequences). The BIOSNAP, DAVIS, and BindingDB databases (DBs) were used (alone or together) for learning. The final model, taught by both ChemBERTa and ProtBert and the integrated DBs, afforded the best DTI predictive performance to date based on the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and precision-recall-AUC values compared with previous models. The performance of the final model was verified using a specific case study on 13 pairs of subtrates and the metabolic enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP). The final model afforded excellent DTI prediction. As the real-world interactions between drugs and target proteins are expected to exhibit specific patterns, pretraining with ChemBERTa and ProtBert could teach such patterns. Learning the patterns of such interactions would enhance DTI accuracy if learning employs large, well-balanced datasets that cover all relationships between drugs and target proteins.},
